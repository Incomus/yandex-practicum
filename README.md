# yandex-practicum
work in progress

Computer vision project, that describes usage of TensorFlow's Keras, ResNet and convolutional neural networks was ~lost forever~ found, but most of the actual inner workings were left to Yandex, all I had to do was create simple layered neural networks so that they could put it into their actually complicated pipeline(that they didn't teach us), much sadness
